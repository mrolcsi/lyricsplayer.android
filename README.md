Lyrics Player for Android
=========================

A simple MP3 player with the capability of downloading lyrics in LRC format, and displaying them in sync with the song.

**Current features are:**
- MP3 playback with standard playback controls (play/pause/seeking)
- Downloading lyrics from my "server" (see notes below)
- Displaying synchronized lyrics ([LRC format][1])
- Caching lyrics on SD Card for offline viewing

**Some features to come:**
- Playlist support (like in any other media player)
- Better tag support (metadata tags, multiple time tags in one line, etc.)
- LRC Editor: 

> - Paste untimed lyrics from clipboard
> - Add/delete line(s)
> - Sync lines to the currently playing song with a simple click

**Notes:**
> Since I couldn't find any good open databases with LRC files I chose to host my own, and populate it with my own collection. Because of this, the amount of files is pretty scarce.
> These files are obtained from the [MiniLyrics][2] database.
> An up to date index of the LRC files can always be found [here][3].
> You can aéways find a pre-built APK in the root of the repo, named "LyricsPlayer.apk".
